# Wrist Rests for Dactyl Keyboard

These are dimensioned with the Kinesis wrist pads in mind. I made the height to fit what I find comfortable, might be you want something different. Under the legs there are indents for putting little rubber feet, to stop them sliding around. Everything is parameterized and can be customized in the SCAD file.
